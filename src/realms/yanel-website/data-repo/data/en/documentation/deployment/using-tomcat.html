    <h1>Using Tomcat</h1>
    <h2>Session Persistence</h2>

    <p>
Tomcat has Session Persistence ENABLED per default. 
</p>

<p>
This means that during shutdown, all sessions get serialized into the file 
</p>

<p>
<code>work/Catalina/localhost/_/SESSIONS.ser</code>
</p>

<p>
and get restored into memory at startup.
</p>

<p>
If you run an application with thousands of sessions, shutdown and startup time can become quite long.
</p>

<p>
To disable session persistence, just uncomment this line in <code>conf/context.xml</code>:
</p>

<p>
&lt;Manager pathname=""/&gt;
    </p>
